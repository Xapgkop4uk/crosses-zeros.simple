# Main sortings using javascript

realisation of basic sorting, list of released for current moment:

* Bubble
* Cocktail
* Insertion
* Gnome
* Merge
* Binary Tree
* Tim

In this folder you can find "test.js". Test shows that my realisation of the binary tree is the fastest among the presented sortings. on 2 times faster then Merge and 8 than TimSort. I think my algorithm of tim sort isn't optimisated, but i don't believe that it can be faster then bTree sort.
